# Martel Laundry Status Page

This is the code for the the Martel laundry status page.

## Running the server

To start the server, you must have `node.js` and `npm` installed. Then run the following command

```
npm start
```

## Testing

To test the website, start the server

```
npm start
```

By default, this will start the server on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000). First open [localhost:3000/test.html](localhost:3000/test.html). Here you can enter in sample CSV strings that will act like the hardware server.

Then you can open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000). This will show the website that will be available to the user. You can change the data on the [test.html](localhost:3000/test.html) and the index will change.
